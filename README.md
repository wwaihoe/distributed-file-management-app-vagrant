## 3-Tiered Web App
### Setup
Vagrant to run multiple virtual machines.\
3 virtual machines are run on Oracle VM VirtualBox.
-	Vagrant box used: " ubuntu/mantic64” (Ubuntu 23.10 (Mantic Minotaur))\
1. Web application front-end
- Node.js, Express.js
-	User-interface
    -	Shows all files and their attributes.
    -	Provides upload/download/remove functionality for user.\
2. Application logic
-	Node.js, Express.js, Multer
-	Keeps track of files and their attributes in the current state.
-	Checks if file in upload/download/remove request is in storage.\
3. MinIO object storage (Client and Server)
-	Node.js, Express.js, MinIO
-	MinIO server for object storage.
-	MinIO client sends presigned link for uploading upon receiving valid upload request.
-	Handles removal of files from MinIO object store.
-	Sends presigned download link generated by MinIO upon receiving valid download request.

#### Flow of events
a.	Upload  
1.	Web app takes in file as user input.
2.	Upon clicking upload button, sends a POST request with the file to app logic.
3.	App logic checks for repeated names to avoid naming conflicts.
4.	App logic sends GET request to MinIO for presigned URL for file upload.
5.	Server with MinIO client sends presigned URL to app logic.
6.	App logic sends PUT request with file to be uploaded to the presigned URL to upload file to MinIO.
7.	Upon successful upload, app logic keeps track of the file and its attributes.\

b.	Download
1.	Upon clicking download button, web app sends POST request with the file to app logic.
2.	App logic checks if file exists.
3.	If exists, app logic sends POST request with filename to server with MinIO client.
4.	 Server with MinIO client sends presigned URL to app logic.
5.	App logic sends the URL back to the web app for download to commence.\

c.	Remove
1.	Upon clicking the remove button, web app sends POST request with the file to app logic.
2.	App logic checks if file exists.
3.	If exists, app logic sends POST request with filename to server with MinIO client.
4.	Server with MinIO client removes file from MinIO bucket.\

d.	Refresh page
1.	Every time the window loads, web app sends a GET request to app logic.
2.	App logic sends the array of files and their attributes to web app.
3.	Web app loads each file and its attributes onto the page.

#### Steps to start web app:
1.	Navigate to folder with vagrantfile.
2.	Run “vagrant up” to create VM instances.
3.	Use “vagrant ssh {machine name}” to login to all the VMs.
4.	In web app front end VM, navigate to “webapp” folder and run front end server with “node app.js”.
5.	In applogic VM, navigate to “applogic” folder and run application logic server with “node app.js”.
6.	In objectstore VM, navigate to “minioclient” folder and use command “minio server ~/minio --console-address :9090” to start MinIO server. Run MinIO client server with “node minioclient.js”.
